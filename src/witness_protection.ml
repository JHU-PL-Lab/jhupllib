(**
   This module provides a means by which a registry of "witnesses" can be
   created.  Here, a witness is a representative of another (typically more
   complex) value.  A witness registry is a mutable structure which
   monotonically accumulates values, mapping distinct values to distinct
   witnesses.  The primary use of such a registry is to accelerate comparison
   operations.  For instance, using witnesses as keys in a tree-based dictionary
   may be faster than using the original values if the comparison between two
   values is an expensive operation.
